"""Path-safety primitives used everywhere Curio composes a filesystem path
from untrusted input.

Threat model
------------
Any string that originates (directly or indirectly) from an HTTP request,
a workflow spec, a saved manifest, an environment variable that a user can
influence, or any other non-hard-coded source is **untrusted**. Joining such
a string naively onto a base directory lets an attacker read or clobber
files outside Curio's sandbox via classic path-traversal payloads:

- ``"../../etc/passwd"`` — ``..`` segments walking above the base.
- ``"subdir/../../../etc/shadow"`` — traversal buried mid-path.
- ``"foo\x00.txt"`` — NUL byte truncation tricks on C bindings.
- ``"foo/bar"`` when a single segment is expected — silently creates
  nested directories the caller didn't intend.
- Symlinks that already live on disk and point outside the base.
- Prefix-matching false positives (e.g. ``/tmp/data`` vs ``/tmp/data-evil``
  under a naive ``str.startswith`` check).

Any code in Curio that builds a path from untrusted input MUST route the
untrusted segments through this module before touching the filesystem.
Routing everything through one chokepoint gives us:

* a single place to audit,
* uniform error behaviour (:class:`PathTraversalError`, a
  :class:`PermissionError` subclass), and
* consistent error messages — every rejection is prefixed with
  ``"Path traversal blocked"`` so tests and log parsers can assert on a
  single stable token.

Two layers of defence
---------------------
1. **Component validation** (primary) — :func:`validate_component` rejects
   each individual segment *before any syscall happens* if it contains
   ``..`` / ``.`` reserved names, forward or backward slashes, NUL bytes,
   control characters, is empty/non-string, or contains characters outside
   ``[A-Za-z0-9._-]``. Catching traversal up front is cheap and never
   depends on filesystem state.

2. **Containment check** (belt-and-braces) — :func:`is_within` verifies the
   final resolved path is inside the resolved base using
   :meth:`pathlib.PurePath.relative_to` (proper path-segment semantics, not
   string prefix matching). This catches symlink escapes and anything the
   component check missed — and remains safe even if callers opt out of
   validation.

Examples
--------
Happy path::

    >>> from utk_curio.backend.app.common.safe_paths import safe_join
    >>> safe_join("/srv/curio/users", "42", "projects", "abc-123")
    PosixPath('/srv/curio/users/42/projects/abc-123')

Traversal is rejected up front::

    >>> safe_join("/srv/curio/users", "42", "projects", "../../etc")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    PathTraversalError: Path traversal blocked: path component contains a
    path separator: '../../etc'

Symlink escape is still caught even if the caller skips per-segment
validation::

    >>> # /srv/curio/users/evil -> /etc
    >>> safe_join("/srv/curio/users", "evil", "passwd", validate=False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    PathTraversalError: Path traversal blocked: resolved path /etc/passwd
    escapes base /srv/curio/users

Migration notes
---------------
When migrating a call site, prefer :func:`safe_join` over manual
``Path(base) / untrusted`` + ``startswith`` checks. See
``utk_curio/backend/app/projects/storage.py`` and the ``/get`` handler in
``utk_curio/backend/app/api/routes.py`` for canonical usages.

    """Join *parts* under *base* and guarantee the result stays inside *base*.

    This is the workhorse of the module. It is the recommended way to build
    any filesystem path that mixes a trusted base with untrusted segments.
    The function applies both defences:

    1. If *validate* is ``True`` (the default), each of *parts* is run
       through :func:`validate_component`. Traversal payloads are rejected
       before any syscall runs.
    2. The joined path is then ``resolve()``\\ 'd and checked with
       :func:`is_within`. This step **always** runs, even when
       ``validate=False``, and catches symlink escapes plus anything the
       segment check missed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base:
        Trusted root directory. Must be hard-coded, derived from trusted
        configuration, or itself the output of an earlier ``safe_join``.
        It is ``resolve()``\\ 'd before the containment check.
    *parts:
        Zero or more path segments to append to *base*. A mix of literal
        strings (``"projects"``) and untrusted values (a user-supplied
        project id) is fine — when ``validate=True`` the literal segments
        pass trivially because they match the safe charset.
    validate:
        When ``True`` (default), validate every segment in *parts* with
        :func:`validate_component`. Set to ``False`` **only** when either:

        - the segments have already been validated by the caller (avoid
          double work — see ``storage.copy_outputs`` for an example), or
        - the endpoint historically accepted nested relative paths and
          tightening to single-segment validation would break clients
          (see the ``/get`` and ``/get-preview`` handlers in
          ``app/api/routes.py``).

        The final containment check runs regardless, so opting out still
        leaves the escape-proof guarantee intact.
    field:
        Human-readable label used in component-level error messages.

    Returns
    -------
    pathlib.Path
        The fully-resolved absolute path. Guaranteed to satisfy
        ``is_within(returned_path, Path(base).resolve())``.

    Raises
    ------
    PathTraversalError
        - A segment fails :func:`validate_component` (when ``validate`` is
          ``True``), or
        - the resolved target escapes *base* (always).

    Examples
    --------
    Typical usage — trusted literals + one untrusted segment::

        return safe_join(
            users_base,            # trusted
            str(int(user_id)),     # trusted (coerced to digits)
            "projects",            # trusted literal
            project_id,            # UNTRUSTED — validated here
            field="project_id",
        )

    Skipping per-segment validation for a legacy endpoint that still wants
    the containment guarantee::

        try:
            full_path = safe_join(
                base_path, file_name, validate=False, field="fileName",
